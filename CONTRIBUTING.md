Thank you for your interest in contributing to Missing Plugin Exception Detective! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Vision

Our goal is to create the most comprehensive and user-friendly Flutter plugin diagnostic tool that:
- Saves developers 2-4 hours of debugging time per week
- Provides intelligent, actionable solutions
- Maintains enterprise-grade quality standards
- Supports the entire Flutter ecosystem

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.3.0)
- Dart SDK (>=2.17.0)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/missing_plugin_exception_detective.git
   cd missing_plugin_exception_detective
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   flutter test
   
   # Run analysis
   dart analyze
   
   # Format code
   dart format .
   
   # Test CLI
   dart bin/missing_plugin_exception_detective.dart --help
   ```

4. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines:

- **Formatting**: Use `dart format` before committing
- **Linting**: All code must pass `dart analyze` without warnings
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must have dartdoc comments
- **Testing**: Maintain ‚â•90% test coverage

### Project Structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/      # End-to-end tests
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`PluginIssue`, `DiagnosticResult`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (`analyzeProject`, `issueCount`)
- **Constants**: lowerCamelCase (`maxScanDuration`)
- **Files**: snake_case (`plugin_issue.dart`, `static_analyzer.dart`)

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** (Required)
   - Test individual functions and classes
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Tests** (Required)
   - Test component interactions
   - Use real file system operations
   - Verify end-to-end workflows

3. **CLI Tests** (Required)
   - Test command-line interface
   - Verify output formats
   - Test error handling

### Writing Tests

```dart
// Good test structure
group('PluginIssue', () {
  test('should create issue with required fields', () {
    // Arrange
    const pluginName = 'test_plugin';
    
    // Act
    final issue = PluginIssue(
      pluginName: pluginName,
      issueType: IssueType.missingRegistration,
      severity: IssueSeverity.high,
      description: 'Test description',
      affectedPlatforms: ['android'],
    );
    
    // Assert
    expect(issue.pluginName, equals(pluginName));
    expect(issue.severity, equals(IssueSeverity.high));
  });
});
```

### Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum**: 90% overall coverage
- **Core Components**: 95% coverage required
- **CLI**: 85% coverage (due to platform-specific code)
- **Integration**: 80% coverage

Run coverage:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Core Components** (`lib/src/core/`)
   - Domain models and business logic
   - Platform-agnostic code
   - High test coverage required

2. **Analyzers** (`lib/src/analyzers/`)
   - Static analysis logic
   - Runtime detection systems
   - Platform-specific implementations

3. **Resolvers** (`lib/src/resolvers/`)
   - Resolution guide generation
   - Platform-specific solutions
   - Step-by-step instructions

4. **CLI** (`lib/src/cli/`)
   - Command-line interface
   - Output formatting
   - User interaction

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each class has a single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Minimal coupling

2. **Testability**
   - Dependency injection for external services
   - Pure functions where possible
   - Mockable interfaces

3. **Performance**
   - Async/await for I/O operations
   - Lazy loading where appropriate
   - Memory-efficient algorithms

4. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture for new analyzers
   - Configurable behavior
   - Clear extension points

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

```dart
/// Detects and analyzes Flutter plugin configuration issues.
///
/// The [StaticAnalyzer] examines project files to identify potential
/// plugin registration problems, version mismatches, and configuration
/// issues across different platforms.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final analyzer = StaticAnalyzer();
/// final issues = await analyzer.analyze(
///   projectPath: '/path/to/project',
///   includePlatforms: ['android', 'ios'],
/// );
/// ```
class StaticAnalyzer {
  /// Creates a new static analyzer instance.
  const StaticAnalyzer();
  
  /// Analyzes the Flutter project for plugin configuration issues.
  ///
  /// Returns a list of [PluginIssue]s found during analysis.
  /// The [projectPath] must point to a valid Flutter project directory.
  /// 
  /// Throws [ArgumentError] if the project path is invalid.
  Future<List<PluginIssue>> analyze({
    required String projectPath,
    List<String> includePlatforms = const ['android', 'ios'],
    List<String> excludePlugins = const <String>[],
  }) async {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```

### API Documentation

- All public classes and methods must have dartdoc comments
- Include usage examples for complex APIs
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Use `///` for dartdoc, `//` for implementation comments
